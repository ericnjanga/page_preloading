#Page preloading

Page template completely preloaded via CSS3 animations, SVG and JavaScript (jQuery). Fallbacks are used for non compliant browsers (Modernizr library).

##Note:
This small application is a remake of codedrop tutorial: https://github.com/codrops/PagePreloadingEffect.

##What's different from the original:
1) All its done under Gulp package manager
2) Browserify is used to manage the JavaScript
3) JavaScript is written in Coffee Script

All my thanks to Codrops and their amazing professionals who are all a great inspiration for me.
